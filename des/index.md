<h1> Dietary energy supply </h1> 
<p>The dietary energy supply (DES) is the food available for human consumption, expressed in kilocalories per person per day. At the country level, it is calculated as a measure of food available for human use after taking out all non-food utilization, including exports, industrial use, animal feed, seed, wastage and changes in stocks. In 1961 the average global calorie availability was as low as 2 196 kcal/cap/day; by 2011, it had reached 2 870 kcal/cap/day, and was centered more around a narrow base of staple grains as well as meat and dairy products.</p>
